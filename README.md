# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game made using React. I made it to practice my new React knowledge, learn how to deploy React apps using GitHub pages, and for my friend ;)

## Features
- Single-player and dual-player modes
- Possibility to reset the game before it ends
- Press **R** to reset the game
- Press **G** to go to the page's GitHub repository
- Possibility to make the computer do random moves or use AI.

## How to use
Just go to the website's link: https://alessandro-sherhey.github.io/tic-tac-toe/

## AI
The AI algorithm is made entirely by me. It's not *real* AI, as it can't be used for other stuff and it can't be trained. It's using predefined possibilities. In a few words it's "thinking" process is:
- Evaluate the situation
- Found an occasion to win? Do the move.
- Found a threat? _(you, the human, are about to win)_ Do the move.
- Didn't find anything? Make a random move.

I still want to improve it in a way I already thought of, I _just_ have to implement it in the code. In the meanwhile it's (kinda) working and it's usable, so I published it.

## Other stuff
For those who want to know, I **didn't** make the website's icon. It was AI generated, as it was faster for me, and I don't have the skills to make a good icon :'(
